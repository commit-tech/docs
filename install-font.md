https://superuser.com/questions/118025/using-custom-fonts-without-administrator-rights  

1. download and install the apps (no admin pwd req.), better to install for all user, default install folder `C:\`
2. after the app is installed, copy the font into `<PortableApps>\PortableApps\PortableApps.com\Data\Fonts` (`<PortableApps>` refer to the folder which the app is installed in, in this case `C:\`) (use `Fonts` with `s` (plural form))
3. restart the app. if the app is not found in the start menu, go to the installation directory. In this case `C:\PortableApps`
4. the font should be usable in all the programmes installed in windows
5. repeat the steps for new fonts  

**NOTE:**  
The app can actually be used to “install” other programmes available in the app, like 7-zip, notepad++, etc
